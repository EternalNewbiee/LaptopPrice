            - **Price and RAM**: The strongest positive correlation with laptop price is RAM (**0.74**), suggesting that laptops with more RAM tend to be significantly more expensive.
            - **Screen Size**: Both 'Inches' (**0.39**) and 'ScreenW' (**0.55**) have a moderate positive correlation with price. This indicates that laptops with larger screens tend to be more costly.
            - **CPU and GPU Characteristics**: The CPU frequency (**0.43**) and GPU company (**0.48**) also show a moderate correlation with laptop prices, signifying that more advanced CPUs and GPUs contribute to a higher price.
            - **Weight**: There is a moderate positive correlation (**0.39**) between laptop weight and price, likely because more powerful components and larger screens make laptops heavier.
            - **Primary and Secondary Storage**: A weak positive correlation exists between Primary Storage (**0.18**) and price, indicating that laptops with larger primary storage capacities are slightly more expensive. Secondary Storage Type has a negative correlation (**-0.52**), meaning that certain types of secondary storage (likely HDDs) are associated with cheaper laptops.
            - **Retina Display and Touchscreen**: Both features have weak correlations with price, suggesting they have some influence but are not the primary determinants.
            
            In summary, RAM, screen size, CPU/GPU capabilities, and weight are the most influential factors driving laptop prices in this dataset, while other attributes have lesser but noticeable effects.

            From analyzing the data in our dataset, we conclude that **RAM** emerges as the most significant determinant for laptop prices. Laptop prices with higher RAM provide a crucial role in system performance, supporting the notion that more RAM generally leads to higher prices. Factors like screen specifications, storage types, and primary storage only came in second, third, and fourth respectively.
            
            - **RAM** (**0.740287**): Emerges as the most significant determinant for laptop prices. Higher RAM provides a crucial role in system performance, supporting the notion that more RAM generally leads to higher prices.
            - **Screen Width** (**0.552491**) and **Screen Height** (**0.548529**): These screen specifications show a moderate positive correlation with price, indicating that display quality is an important factor in pricing.
            - **Primary Storage Type** (**0.503655**): Has a moderate correlation with price, suggesting that the type of storage (likely SSD vs HDD) plays a notable role in determining a laptop's cost.
            - **CPU Model** (**0.473860**) and **CPU Frequency** (**0.428847**): Both show a moderate correlation with price, indicating that processor specifications are important, but not as crucial as RAM or screen specs in this dataset.
            - **Screen** (**0.403834**): This general screen factor (possibly referring to overall screen size or quality) shows the weakest correlation among the listed factors, but still has a moderate positive influence on price.
